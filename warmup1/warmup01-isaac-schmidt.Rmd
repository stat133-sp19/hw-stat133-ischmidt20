#### Famous Quote


>"Jedi. The peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic. Cowards. Wallowing... nesting... hiding in the peace they enforce. Their strength is waning. Deep down, they know they cannot maintain order forever. And when their time begins to tumble into darkness.. they will find me waiting for them."

# Cooking Recipe

## Key Lime Pie Popsicles

![](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/9591713189_12ac7b9e56_h.jpg?w=350)

#### Ingredients

* Approx 4 large regular limes or several key limes
* 1 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk
* 1 cup half-and-half
* 3 cups coarsely crushed graham crackers
* pinch of salt

#### Other tools

* Popsicle molds, or substitute such as champagne flutes
* Juicer
* Medium bowl
* Whisk
* Freezer

#### Procedure

1. Zest limes until you have about 2 teaspoons of zest in a medium bowl.
2. Juice limes until you have about 3/4 cup lime juice.
3. Mix juice, condensed milk, half-and-half, salt, and zest and whisk until thoroughly combined.
4. Pour into popsicle molds or other substitute.
5. Freeze until completely frozen, about 5 hours.
6. Dip molds in lukewarm water for about 10 seconds to unmold the popsicles.
7. Roll popsicles in crushed cookie crumbs until each is completely covered.

These popsicles are of course best enjoyed on a hot summer day, but they can make for a refreshing snack at any point in the year! Feel free to try a similar recipe with other sour fruits, such as lemons or grapefruits.

# Euclidean Distance


Definition
------------------------
--------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p$_{1}$, p$_{2}$,..., p$_{n}$) and **q** = (q$_{1}$, q$_{2}$,..., q$_{n}$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\textbf{p}, \textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q}, \textbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2 }$$

$$ \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2} .$$

The position of a point in Euclidean *n*-space is called a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of a vector:

$$ \| \mathbf{p} \|  = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 +...+ p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}}, $$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
